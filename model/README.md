# Application Model

A comprehensive management of the runtime lifecycle of applications requires:

1. a detailed understanding of the structure of the application and its components,
2. a description of the relevant components,
3. a way of distinguishing these elements in an unambiguous way and
4. a model describing in which states the applications and its components may be
   and what kind of transitions between these states are allowed.

The standards described in the following sections structure the way applications
are handled by the orchestrator. VNFs which follow these standards will be much
easier to integrate into the general cloud automation framework.
